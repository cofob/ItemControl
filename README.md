# ItemControl

Control enchants on items.

## Demonstration

[![](https://v.lor.sh/static/thumbnails/6f0ea575-fb92-40cc-820d-a169218cbb77.jpg)](https://v.lor.sh/videos/watch/b90e379b-a638-4107-a5ee-506b491d90ce)

## How it works?

Every time a player opens a chest / shulker, the plugin checks his inventory for illegal items, and removes impossible enchantments.

## Configuration

At the moment, it is not planned to introduce configuration files, since the plugin takes information directly from the spigot.

## Download

You can download plugin from [releases page](https://git.cofob.ru/cofob/ItemControl/releases), or dev version in [Jenkins](https://ci.cofob.ru/job/ItemControl/job/Build/lastSuccessfulBuild/).
